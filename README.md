Another interval timer (AiT) that targets portable devices for your timing needs.  This application has been intended for interval workouts, where there are active and inactive segments.

Features in this application are:
* Adjustable parameters for segments and amount of countdown time before starting interval timer.
* Enable/disable 5, 10 and 15 second warnings to indicate active segment is ending.
* Light or dark background for main display.

Planned features:
* Application base themes (Light and Dark) and accent themes (eg: 'RGB and sometimes Y')
* Countdown timer.
* Stopwatch that laps on a tap.
* Revamp timer with seqences.  For instance, 10 sec countdown, followed by 12 minute workout and 10 minute timer.
* Fullscreen mode when timer is running.

## About
This is an Ionic 3.8 project that is intended to target Android and iOS devices.  Ionic leverages Angular, Cordova, RxJS, Sass, TypeScript and Webpack, to name a few.  This was my first project using Ionic.

I plan to have this available on Google Play and Apple iTunes in the next few weeks (e.t.a. 11/30/2017)
